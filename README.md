# TCP-Echo-Client-Server
A simple way to understand sockets in C language

>**The program is already compiled and ready to use. Special thanks to Andreas Luft for co-programming!**

## Installation
There is nothing to install :D

## Usage
* To start the server under Linux, the following command is sufficient
  * ./server &gt;&gt;portnumber&lt;&lt;
* To start the client under Linux, the following command is sufficient
  * ./client &gt;&gt;server-ip&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;server-portnumber&lt;&lt;

## Features
* The principle is that of an echo. When the client sends a text string to the server, the server receives it and sends it back originally (echo) 
  
### Information
* The Code is self-explanatory commented
